## Angulos internos y externos
- Los angulos internos suman 180 grados, los externos si extendemos las lineas suman 360 grados
- Los angulos internos de un pentagono suman  540 por que caben 3 triangulos dentro
- La formula para saber los angulos internos es la siguiente
> n x 360 = 180 + (sum of the interior angles)*


## Triangles
> Triangle inequality, un lado de un triangulo no puede ser igual omenor que uno de los otros dos lados ni igual o mayor a la suma de ambos lados -> La diferencia entre dos lados te da el minimo (no inclusivo), y la suma de los dos lados te da el maximo (no inclusivo)


# Glosario
- Point: Location
- Line: a straight path extending infinitely in oposite directions
- Line segment: a horizontal bar avobe two points on the line
- Ray: Part of a line that starts at a point and extends infinitely in one direction
- Vertex: The point of intersection of two or more line segments, rays or, lines
- Angle: formed by two rays with the some endpoint, the vertex
- Parallel lines: lines that are always the same distance apart They never meet
- Perpendicular lines: una cruz, lines that intersect to form four right angles
- Plane: a flat 2d surface that extends infinitely in all directions
- Coplanar: pooints lie on the same plane
- Congruent lines: Two line segments that have the same length
- Segment mid point a poiont that divides the line segment into two congruent segments
- Segment bisector: is a line ray, segment, or plane that passes through a ssegment at its midpoint (bisects it).
- Right angle: measures 90
- Acute angle: Measures less than 90
- Obtuse angle: Measures greater than 90 and less than 180
- Adjacent angles: Angles that lie in the same plane, have a commond (the same) vertex, share a common side, and have no common interior points.
- Non-Adjacent angles: Angles that do not have a vertex or a side in common.
- Congruent Angles: Two angles are congruent if their angle measures are equal
- Angle pairs: Two angles can be related to each other by their measures or orientations. These are called Angle Pairs. There are different types of angle pairs.
- Adjacent Angles: Lie in the same plane, have a common vertex, share a common side, and have no common interior points.
- Vertical angles: are nonadjacent and opposite each other. They are formed when two lines intersect. They share same vertex.
- Complementary angles: two angles whose sum is 90 degrees
- Supplementary angles: Two angles whose sum is 180
- Linear Pair: Two angles that are adjacent and supplementary
- Angle Bisectors: An angle bisector is a ray that divides an angle into two congruent angles.
- Perpendicular bisector: A Perpendicular Bisector is a line, ray or line segment that divides a line segment into two congruent segments and forms four right angles with it.
- Inductive Reasoning is used to form hypotheses (explanations) based on a set of observations. The explanation or conclusion, is called a Conjecture
- Inductive Reasoning: uses specific examples or past observations to reach a conclusion
- Deductive ReasoningL uses given facts and statements to reach a conclusion logically.
